Start the game by running the poker.py script from terminal.

About the game:
In each iteration, five cards are selected at random for both players from a deck of 56 cards and then compared according to poker hand ranks.

The game runs until 'q' is pressed or until there aren't enough cards left in the deck to make two hands (select five cards for each player).

The player who won the most number of rounds is declared the winner.
